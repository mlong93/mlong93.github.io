I bought tickets to Boston 14 hours before my flight. Best decision ever.

I'm writing this from a friend's room at MIT. I'm crashing with her for a week and I am endlessly grateful she offered to host me five minutes after I bought my tickets.

Coming back to Boston has been a godsend. I had my doubts on my flight here, asking myself if I overreacted because I could totally last another couple of weeks in Zürich. Ever since stepping foot in Cambridge though, it feels like I never left. I can't even imagine Zürich. It is worlds away. I feel like it was a far-off dream because I can't remember ever being there.

Right after I booked my flights, my friend in Zürich saw me grinning wildly as I texted my friends. "You look so happy. This was a good decision." Hours after I got off the plane and found myself in Cava, my friend's boyfriend said, "Look at Mindy's face right now. She's smiling so hard." 

I miss Boston.

For some reason Boston is 70 degrees this week. It's so out of character, but I'm not complaining because it means half the leaves are still clinging onto the trees. I still caught fall in Boston. 

Fall is definitely Boston's best look. Skyscrapers boldly standing behind rows of red brick, the wide expanse of the Charles lined with red and yellow trees. I'll remember Boston like this for a very long time.

Going abroad has made me appreciate this city and my time at MIT more. Now I actually feel so grateful to be here as an undergraduate specifically. This is one of the few schools that encourages you to be different and unorthodox and prides itself on that rather than forcing you to conform to a certain identity. I think about everyone who's ever studied here and who will study here and how all our lives have changed from the four short years we've been here. We don't know each other, but we share a common experience. It's sad to think once I arrive to campus in the spring I'll be counting down the days I have left here.
