# *Exhalation*, Ted Chiang

My favorites were *The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate* (time, desire), *The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling* (memory, infallibility, objectivity), and *Omphalos* (writing, words, truth). I liked how almost each story was based on an advanced invention or a dystopian retelling of a past society and how a theme or two was tied into the story. Personally I felt that some of the stories were really dragged out but I can see he's doing it to emphasize some danger posed by each situation. *Black Mirror* could draw inspiration from some of these.

# *Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom*, Stephen Platt
