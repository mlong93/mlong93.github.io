May 8, 2021: I wrote this in my diary a week ago at 2 AM but am only transcribing it here now.

1. I watched part of "Nomadland" last night. The desert landscapes really got me. I love nature. My favorite landscapes are snow-capped mountains, green pines, and crystal lakes. Think Banff. But these deserts. Especially the Sonoran. The shrubs and dust and saguaros. When I'm old -- like 50 or 60 or more -- I'll still remember fondly those views. My childhood deserts and mountains that lovingly embraced me. That feeling of going home, the place that raised me. 少小离家老大回。*They might not be the prettiest but they're home.[^1]*

2. Mrs. Fox just popped up on my FB recommended list. Now I'm thinking about how different she is from my HASS professors in college. Her passion for art, the way her voice and eyes lit up when she would talk about a piece. She didn't go to some renowned liberal arts school and learn to write like a critic. But she still understands the art, appreciates it, loves it. She's like a student. I enjoyed her class too. It's a shame I was worried about my AP score the entire time...
