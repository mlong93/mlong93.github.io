I can't believe I'll be on a flight back to Boston in 10 hours! I did a lot this last week before I left to school for the second time (first time was freshman fall):

1. Hiked Piestewa Peak on Tuesday
2. iOS GSD on Wednesday
3. Renewed my passport, saw a peacock, bought oranges, bought a cara cara orange tree, ate a Korean corn dog, went grocery shopping, and bought a cake from Paris Baguette on Thursday. First time I went shopping with my mom in months ðŸ˜ƒ My family also drove out to Globe at night to go stargazing. The stars are so pretty ðŸŒƒ! Hopefully I can go again (in AZ) during the latter half of the year and actually see the Milky Way.
4. Cooked and played Minecraft on Friday
5. Bought makeup and my last Frost gelato (at least for a few more months), ate a homemade Chinese New Year/farewell lunch and dinner, and played some football with my brother yesterday (Saturday)
6. Jetting off to Cambridge at 10 am AZ time!

This upcoming week will be hectic but hopefully I'll make it through. I'm super excited to see my friends again (and some for the first time) ðŸ¤
