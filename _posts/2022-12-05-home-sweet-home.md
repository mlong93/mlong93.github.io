I made it back to Arizona with all three luggages! I'm still a little sad Switzerland is over. Zürich and the people I met there seem worlds away from the deserts of America. I am glad to be back home though becauuse for the first time since January of this year, I feel ready to settle down into my normal routine of studying, running, reading, baking, and cooking.

On another note, I read my first book in months on the flight from London to Phoenix: Murakami's *Killing Commendatore*. I thought I would struggle to read again after so long but actually I could not put the book down. I bought it in Amsterdam intending to read it in my inifinite boredom of my room in Zürich but could never bring myself to. I'm glad though I read it this late because the events of the book are inextricably linked to places I visited in Prague and Vienna.

For one, Commendatore refers to Il Commendatore of Mozart's *Don Giovanni*. Menshiki mentions how he watched the opera in Prague, the site of its original premiere in 1787. Funnily enough, I saw the exact theater where that took place and remember that placed conspicuously in front of the theater is an iron statue of Il Commendatore, a tribute of the citizens of Prague to Mozart. 

Tomohiko Amada lived in Vienna at the time of the *Anschluss*, or Nazi annexation of Austria. I visited the balcony where Hitler announced this when I was in Vienna and also the State Opera House Tomohiko frequented as a young man there.

Coincidence that every European place in the novel was a place on my Central Europe tour that struck me? Perhaps.
