Today was a pivotal day in US history and world history. The country/capital the entire world looks up to, the so-called "city upon a hill" that William Bradford foresaw, had just been reduced to a riotous, undemocratic scene that this country condemend and even started invasions as a result of.

As an amateur historian, I can think of two implications of the events that transpired. 

1. The developing world loses its faith in American democracy and pivots to other governments for guidance, aka China. Developed countries and strategic allies are open to more partnerships with China, and America loses its pedestal on the world stage. Trumpism's isolationaist and "America First" ideology have already hastened that development.

2. Subsequent administrations and lawmakers unite the country and restore faith in government. Ultimately, the cause of Trumpism was partly due to the disillusionment with the government or the "establishment". Some ways this situation could be ameliorated are via effective COVID-19 policies, participation in multinational organizations, and of course, support of a strong economy.

A later post that I will hopefully write this weekend will go more in depth on my thoughts.
