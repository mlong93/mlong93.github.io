You know that feeling you get when you haven't been outside, had good food, and taken nice photos for a long time. Well that was yesterday.

I rediscovered [Postino](https://www.postinowinecafe.com/p/food-drink.html)'s and their prosciutto and brie sandwich with arugula and fig jam. Jam on savory sandwiches is literally AMAZING!

Then we missed the sunset because we were trying to build this phone tripod. We built it eventually but there was an extra piece that I still don't know goes where. And then we (tried to) pose and look aesthetic but our best photos were the meme ones.

But the food was good and the vibes were good and we topped it off with [blackberry cabernetüç∑ gelato](https://www.frostgelato.com/menu-items/flavors/). Just like the good ol' days.
