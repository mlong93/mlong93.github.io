Today was a good day! All times in MST (or AZ time).

1. 9-9:30 AM: I had a good meeting with my supervisor at <a href="https://www.detectnow.com/">Detect Now</a>. I know what I'm doing for the next couple days and I'm heading in the right direction!

2. 12-2:30 PM: <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s50-how-to-win-at-texas-holdem-poker-january-iap-2016/">15.s50 How to Win at Texas Hold'em Poker</a> was fun and I learned about equity, pot odds, and ranges. I also got to play a workshop and learned when to fold UTG.

3. 5:20-6 PM: Popped into <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/academic-information/eecs-iap-classes-2021">6.179 Introduction to C/C++</a> on a whim and thought the lecturers were amazing! Also I realized my friend Si Young happened to be in there too. It's been almost a year since we were both in class together.

4. 6:40 PM: Called customer service of a store for an order placed in Novemeber. The wait wasn't too long, and the lady on the phone was so nice and patient, which never happens. She gave me extra points back because it took me a couple times to explain exactly what was wrong. She apologized profusely at the end, but I told her she was awesome (she honestly was). I hope she has a great rest of her day!

Today was a good day! ðŸ˜Š
