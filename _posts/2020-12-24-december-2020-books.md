* <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, Oscar Wilde

Very artistic. Confused what Basil Hayward first saw in Dorian until the end of the book. I knew too much about the book beforehand so the lesson in vanity was expected. Liked the argument of "should life imitate art or should art imitate life". Which is more ideal, art or life? Lord Henry as a foil was a great character device.
* <em>Never Let Me Go</em>, Kazuo Ishiguro

I don't think I'm mature enough to understand this book. Build-up was very dull. Got the gist of the book in part 3 when Kathy and Tommy realize that the deferral was a farce. What's it like to realize your life will end before you grow up? Does your happiness matter if you die before 30?

* <em>Falling Leaves</em>, Adeline Yen Mah

Wow. So emotional. Really made me think of my grandfather and his childhood. If it weren't so emotional I'd call out Yen Mah for exaggerating too much. Her entire family turned on her? She dramatically realized her brother James was a cop out only when her father died? Overly dramatic and quite possibly a sob story.
