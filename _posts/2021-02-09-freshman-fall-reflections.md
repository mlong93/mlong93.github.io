The first time I saw MIT was Campus Preview Weekend (CPW). CPW marked the first of many things I would be introduced to in college. My first campus visit weekend, tase of liquid nitrogen ice cream, frat party, visit to New England, yerba maté, puzzle hunt, rainy and muddy spring. In between the fun and games of CPW, I also squeezed in some time for more serious matters, like scouting clubs I was interested in joining if I committed.  

One such club was Sloan Business Club (SBC). I was interested in SBC because I had also been admitted to several business and technology dual-degree programs and had casually convinced myself that being a product manager was my dream job. When I got to the SBC barbecue during CPW, I learned two kids from my high school were part of the club as well. Even better! Sometime during my conversations with SBC, I heard about the term “quantitative trading” thrown around multiple times. I had no idea what it meant but just smiled and nodded like a true prefrosh.  

When I got back, I looked up the term online and still couldn’t understand what the job entailed. I attended Poker Night with the Poker Club and once again heard “quantitative trading” come up. During the rest of my week of school visits, I heard other finance-sounding terms being thrown around as well. I decided trading sounded cool and told myself that I could become a trader.  

Fast-forward to the fall semester. I officially became an MIT student and started the club rush process. I call it club rush because essentially each pre-professional club on campus holds a week of events during which potential new members are expected to network and get to know the club. The end of the week culminates in an invite-only event, an application, maybe an interview, and maybe an offer to join the club.  

The one club I rushed was SBC. For an hour each day, I dressed in business casual and networked nearly nonstop with close to 20 members of the club. I waded through wads of other freshmen to talk to members in the entrepreneurship initiative. I learned that investment banking is the Wall Street dream but that private equity was even better. I learned that BCG, McKinsey, and Bain were the pinnacles of consulting. I had never heard of investment banking or consulting until then. I didn’t even realize Wall Street was a workplace either.  

After 5+ hours of chatting, I scored an interview for the club but didn’t make it past the final cuts. I was very disappointed, since I had spent so much time and effort trying to join the club. A week later I had all but forgotten about SBC and spent the rest of the semester soaking up PNR, exploring Boston, trying to make friends, and applying for internships.  

Looking back as an overly grown freshman, I think that my first semester was a typical dive into the elite college culture and the disillusionment that comes with it. I rushed and joined preprofessional clubs because I was concerned about my resume, because everyone else around me was also concerned about their resumes. I thought trading was my ideal career because of the tech talks and coffee chats with Citadel and SIG and Jane Street. Or maybe I was interested in working at Airbnb or Dropbox or Facebook.  

Growing up in Gilbert, AZ, I had never heard of careers in IB or consulting or quantitative trading before. The only tech companies I knew where Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. Wall Street was an abstract concept. Yet it seemed as if the students around me had known from kindergarten they had wanted to work on mergers and acquisitions or work with CEOs on internal restructuring. Yes, I was initially carried away by all the hype around such professional clout. Thankfully, some friends helped me rethink what I value in life in the months following and now I'm trying to keep my head straight. Welcome to the East Egg.
