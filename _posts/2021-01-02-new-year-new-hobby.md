It's now 2021! The night of the 31st, I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10620868/"><em>#Alive</em></a> and decided a drone was a nice defense in case of a zombie apocalypse. The next day I cashed in my nonexistent Christmas present and bought a drone. Today, not only did ISU win the Fiesta Bowl, I also flew my first drone! After an hour in the sun figuring out that I couldn't fly in my own neighborhood because I live 4 miles away from an airport, I went to a nearby park and took my first flight. Originally I wasn't very interested in the photography part of the device but after watching some Youtube videos on the stuff you can do with drones, I am now mesmerized. After authorizing my drone to fly in the no-fly zone aka my neighborhood, I will be taking some cool pics tomorrow. Hopefully I have the chance to take some photos in Sedona and Page as well in the next month as well.

On another note, <em>#Alive</em> was a great movie. I was kind of skeptical about it given that I've already watched a couple other Korean zombie flicks, but this one took a totally different spin on the genre. I can also say that Yoo Ah-in is my favorite Korean actor. I saw him before in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7282468/"><em>Burning</em></a> and he was simply amazing.
