This last weekend, including Christmas day on Friday, I started playing [Dragon Quest 9](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/more-platforms/nintendo-ds/games/products/dragon-quest-ix-sentinels-of-the-starry-skies/10077241.html) again.

DQ9 was the only game I played as a kid. Well, not only, but the only game I spent a lot of time on, like 200+ hours. I remember sneaking my DS into my room at night and waking up at 5 AM to finish the game. Unlike the other RPG I played aka Pokémon White, I actually had to spend time to pass each section of the story. It took me 8 days to complete Pokémon White and over a year to complete DQ9. Even after the story ends, there are still endless grottoes and monsters to battle.

I got the game in 3rd grade and it's been 10 years since then. Obviously I spent a lot less time on the it over the years. The last time I played was March 2019 and before that it was sometime in 2015. I have to say, the game is still as addicting as it was when I was 10.
